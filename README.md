# Overview

## Purpose of the application
Have you ever wanted to make your own craft but didn't have the time or the materials?
**Design Your Craft** is a page where you can design an item and have it handcrafted for you. 


## How does it work?

### First step: Choose an item you want to design  
Choose between jewelry boxes, christmas decoration or bottles.

### Second step: Design your product 
Choose between different patterns, decorations or customised messages

### Third step: Order a handcrafted item 
After you designed an item, it will be handcrafted by one of our team members and send out to you!

Users can create a handcrafted item with the **Design Your Craft** application upon their first use of the application. No registration is necessary to design and order an item.


Users who are interested can sign up and have their past designs and orders saved on the profile page. Users details can be saved on their profile to make an order quickly and the information can be edited or deleted easily.

# Features
The following are the features provided in the **Design Your Craft** application. 

## Navigation bar and Footer
* Each page features a **navigation bar** that has 3 navigation links - Home, About Us and Start the design. On a screen size smaller than a tablet the navbar becomes a collapsible element. In the right corner there are Profile and Shopping list icons.

# Site Users 
### Who is the site focused on?
People who want to buy or gift a unique item that they design but don't have the skills/time/materials to create them.


### The following user stories were used to design the website:
1. Mel, â€œI would love to create something for my mom, but I was never good and arts and crafts and honestly, I don't have the time with work and everyday chores to learn a new skill."


# Testing
Testing information can be found in the separate testing file that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/natalijabujevic0708/DesignYourCrafts/blob/master/TESTING.md).


# Database Organisation
Database information can be found in a separate file that can be accessed [here](https://github.com/natalijabujevic0708/DesignYourCrafts/blob/master/DATABASE.md).


# Bugs/ Features Left to Implement
* .draggable() on mobile devices - the function draggable doesn't work on touchscreen devices. The plan was to use the [jQuery UI Touch Punch library](https://github.com/furf/jquery-ui-touch-punch) but it wasn't working when implemented in the code as it looks like it was [deprecated](https://touchpunch.furf.com/). This is still an issue as it's not possible to change the placement of decoration/text while designing on mobile devices.
* different designs of the same product - since the shopping bag is based on the product ids, when a customer creates a design of a product and they create another design of the same product it will replace the original design in the shopping bag.
