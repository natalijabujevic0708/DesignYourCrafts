# Overview

## Purpose of the application
Have you ever wanted to make your own craft but didn't have the time or material?
**Design Your Craft** is a page where you can design an item and have it handcrafted for you. 


## How does it work?

First step: Choose an item you want to design 
Choose between jewlery boxes, christmas decoration or bottles.

Second step: Design your product 
Choose between different patterns, decorations or customised messages

Third step: Order a handcrafted item 
After you desiged an item, it will be handcrafted by one of our team members and send out to you!

Users can create a handcrafted item with the **Design Your Craft** application upon their first use of the application. No registration is necessary to design and order an item.


Users who are interested can sign up and have their past designs and orders info saved in the profile page. Users details can be saved on their profile to make the order quicker and the information can be edited or deleted easily.
