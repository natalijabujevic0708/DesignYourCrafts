# Overview

## Purpose of the application
Have you ever wanted to make your own craft but didn't have the time or material?
**Design Your Craft** is a page where you can design an item and have it handcrafted for you. 


## How does it work?

### First step: Choose an item you want to design  
Choose between jewlery boxes, christmas decoration or bottles.

### Second step: Design your product 
Choose between different patterns, decorations or customised messages

### Third step: Order a handcrafted item 
After you desiged an item, it will be handcrafted by one of our team members and send out to you!

Users can create a handcrafted item with the **Design Your Craft** application upon their first use of the application. No registration is necessary to design and order an item.


Users who are interested can sign up and have their past designs and orders info saved in the profile page. Users details can be saved on their profile to make the order quicker and the information can be edited or deleted easily.

# Features
The following are the features provided in the **Design Your Craft** application. 

## Navigation bar and Footer
* Each page features a **navigation bar** that has 3 navigation links - Home, About Us and Start the design. On a screen size smaller than a tablet the navbar becomes a collapsible element. In the right corner there are Profile and Shopping list icons.


* Each page features **social media links**  at the bottom. They redirect a user to the social media platform opening it in a new window. 

## Home & About page
* Users can learn about the purpose of the site on the Home and About page.
